# Complex Number Quadrant

Write a program that takes three integers as input, representing the sides of a triangle. Use if-else conditions to classify the triangle into one of the following categories:
Equilateral: All sides are equal.
Isosceles: Exactly two sides are equal.
Scalene: All sides are different.
Not a Triangle: If the sum of any two sides is less than or equal to the third side, it's not a valid triangle.
Example Input/Output
Input: 5 5 5
Output: Equilateral
Input: 3 4 5
Output: Scalene
Input: 1 2 3
Output: Not a Triangle
