# Complex Number Quadrant

# Given two numbers representing the real (x) and imaginary (y) parts of a complex number, determine which quadrant or axis the number lies on in the complex plane.
# Quadrant 1: x > 0, y > 0
# Quadrant 2: x < 0, y > 0
# Quadrant 3: x < 0, y < 0
# Quadrant 4: x > 0, y < 0
# If x = 0 and y â‰  0, it lies on the imaginary axis.
# If y = 0 and x â‰  0, it lies on the real axis.
# If x = 0 and y = 0, it is the origin.
# Example Input/Output
# Input: -3 4
# Output: Quadrant 2
# Input: 0 -5
# Output: Imaginary Axis
# Input: 0 0
# Output: Origin
